## F4c3b00k writeup

This challenge was kind of an introduction challenge, but I learned something about OSINT so I thought I would write it up.  The challenge statement told us that a flag was hidden on the ISITDTU Facebook fan page.


The first thing I did was browse to the fan page at https://www.facebook.com/pg/isitdtu/posts/ and `CTRL` + `F` for a `{`.

As you can see however, `ISITDTU{fl4g_1s_n0t_h3r3}`, that's not the flag.
