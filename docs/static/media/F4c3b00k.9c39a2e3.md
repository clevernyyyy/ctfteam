## F4c3b00k writeup

This challenge was kind of an introduction challenge, but I learned something about OSINT so I thought I would write it up.  The challenge statement told us that a flag was hidden on the ISITDTU Facebook fan page.


The first thing I did was browse to the fan page at https://www.facebook.com/pg/isitdtu/posts/ and `CTRL` + `F` for a `{`.

As you can see however, `ISITDTU{fl4g_1s_n0t_h3r3}`, that's not the flag. I wasted significant time pouring over the rest of their facebook page, trying to identify patterns or codes in their pictures. However, that turned out to be a big time sink.

Notice right below the highlighted brace, there is the word `Edited`. Well, I did not know for far too long that you can actually clicked `Edited` and see the edit history. Once I clicked, sure enough, I found the hidden flag.
